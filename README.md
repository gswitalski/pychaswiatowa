# Pychaswiatowa

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Vitest provides fast and modern unit testing capabilities for the application, allowing you to test components, services, and other Angular modules in isolation.

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright enables automated browser testing, simulating real user interactions to verify critical user flows across the application.
